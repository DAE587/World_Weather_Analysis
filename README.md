Weather_Vacation_App:
In Python using Jupyter Notebook

Overview:
	After completing the PlanMyTrip app that use APIs to pull city weather data and hotel location data.  It was asked that we add some additional features to improve the 		app for the end user.
	
		*	We added a weather description field to the data set.
		*	We added an input option for users to identify temperature preferences.
		*	We added nearby hotel information.
		*	We added pop-up on the map that would provide the city weather information on the city selected.
		*	From the potential destinations the user could select four cities and a travel itinerary was created with all the pertinent information for each 				destination city including hotel information.
